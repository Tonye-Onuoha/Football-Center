## Project Description: 
Football Center is a web application created using the Django web-framework whose sole aim is to provide users the opportunity to catch up on their favorite football teams and matches. These football matches however do not occur in real time, which makes sense seeing as real-world matches do not take place every day. Therefore the application only serves to simulate how live matches could be experienced on the platform while providing a seamless interaction between its users.


## Implementation Details

- What is the project about ?

The goal of the project is to build a platform that provides information about football teams/clubs and also simulates live matches, thus giving its users the experience of being up to date on all things concerning football as well as providing an interface for them to communicate with one another.


### STEP 2: Understanding the project functionality
What tasks should the project accomplish ?

The application should be able to carry out the following tasks:
-   Users can create their own personal accounts with login and logout functionality.
-   Users have access to their own personal profile page.
-   Users can view live match scores and statistics (simulated).
-   Users have access to all sorts of information about the teams in europes top 5 leagues.
-   Users can create posts on the platform.
-   Users can view all the posts on the platform.
-   Users can edit their previous posts.

-   Users are also able to follow other existing users on the platform to keep up with their latest posts.
-   Users can view the complete profiles of other users, with access to view their previous posts, biography, other users they follow, as well as users that follow them.

-   A database/DBMS to store users and all the necessary information.
-   APIs are needed to make requests to the database for search and follow functionality.
-   Git repository to track previous changes in the codebase.
